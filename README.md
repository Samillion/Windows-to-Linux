## Windows-to-Linux
A list to help me keep track of possible software alternatives to make the experience reasonable, otherwise the switch will not happen.

I'm not well versed in Linux, so all the information I have is by doing research and comparing results. So errors, bad choices and mistakes are possible.

The goal is to try and plan the best route before making the switch, to not hop back and forth between operating systems.

## Linux
- Fedora https://fedoraproject.org/
  - or Nobara? https://nobaraproject.org/
- Gnome DE

**Switch status:** ❌

## Process
I tend to use open source and FOSS software a lot, which in the most part is available for many platforms or an alternative exists already.

#### Setbacks (cons)
The following issues are not Fedora specific, they seem to be a general occurance within Linux.

It is common to suggest "just use online/web version" as a solution, but that is not effective, it's simply a forced compromise, unfortunately.

- Outdated Software:
  - Due to policy and the fact that in some cases it's about volunteer based work, some packages are outdated
  - Fedora seems to be balanced, from what I've seen it's mostly Debian based distros and indpendent package support (ie: `flatpak`, `rpm`, `deb`), sometimes none (ie: mpv)
  - An alternative would be to build/compile packages yourself, which in itself a huge setback and a chore, from a user experience standpoint, especially ones new to Linux
- GPU Drivers:
  - I keep stumbling upon comments about GPU issues, especially when it comes to Wayland
    - Some have opted to switch back to X11, which seems to have solved their issues
    - Wayland has advantages and is still working out its issues. From a user experience point of view, I'm hesitant
    - Noteworthy: Some distros do not support legacy GPUs (ie: Nobara), there is a workaround usually, but it's an "at your own risk" scenario
    - There are detailed guides, which I genuinely appreciate, as it shows the level of care from everyone involved. The downside is that it's a lot to take in as a user [[#notes](#notes)]
  - Some other comments here and there, mostly solvable by tinkering with a config or a setting. Still, a bothersome chore
- Cloud:
  - No alternative or method for `iCloud Drive`
  - `Rclone` is a huge learning curve, even with a frontend like `Rclone Browser`
    - Having auto-sync and mount (local copy) access with my cloud services would definitely be an annoying chore
    - Affects `Proton Drive`, `Google Drive` and `Microsoft OneDrive`
- Flatpaks are sandboxed by default, which can result in mis-matched themes, no access to folders and such
  - Use `dnf`/`rpm` for installing a package if available and maintained, otherwise, use verified Flatpaks
  - Use `Flatseal` to resolve sandboxed issues, if any
    - As far as I can tell, sometimes the name of the related environment variables are needed, which is a chore, since I'll have to research them when needed
- Internet Download Manager (IDM) alternative [✔️ `solved`:`listed`]
  - Specifically its browser extension integration to capture videos and download them
  - [ABDM](https://github.com/amir1376/ab-download-manager) is a close match, waiting on [feature progress](https://github.com/amir1376/ab-download-manager/issues/9), if any
  - XDM was a possible choice, but development halted for a long time now [[reference](https://github.com/subhra74/xdm/discussions/768#discussioncomment-10842375)]
  - `yt-dlp` offers a static list, so it's not a viable alternative
- WhatsApp [✔️ `solved`:`listed`]

## Notes
- Nvidia Drivers: RPM Fusion => Nvidia Drivers [[#setback](#setbacks-cons)]
  - Might need `libnvidia-egl-wayland1`?
  - Useful reference: https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/NVIDIA
  - Useful reference: https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Wayland/Nvidia
- Look into enabling non-free options (ie: `ffmpeg`):
  - Software Center => enable `non-free` (ie: 3rd party codec packages)
